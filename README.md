Problem Statement:
Can we predict the average basket total of purchases for the next year, for the top 3 websites of different categories (amazon.com, jetblue.com, dominos.com) ?

Why this matters: Without knowing the purchasing behaviors of customers, sales may decrease; Lack of shopping personalization can lead to high churn/low retention of customers. Therefore, we must analyze which characteristics of the customer and/or shopping experience can predict purchasing behavior.
